Did you know that octopuses have three hearts and blue blood? Two of their
hearts pump blood to the gills, while the third pumps it to the rest of the 
body. Interestingly, when an octopus swims, the heart that delivers blood to
the body actually stops beating, which is why they prefer crawling to swimming—it’s
less tiring. Their blue blood comes from a copper-rich protein called hemocyanin,
which is more efficient than hemoglobin for
transporting oxygen in cold, low-oxygen environments like the deep sea.
